/**
 * The PKB datamodel and FHIR do not always have a 1:1 mapping. Life would be wonderful if they did.
 *
 * Frequently, several PKB entities collapse into a single FHIR resource. An example is Patient, which is comprised
 * of PKBPerson, PersonContact, NationalId, OrgLevelId and TeamLevelId. This is pretty easy, as everything in the
 * PKB table routes to a single FHIR resource.
 *
 * However some PKB entities have to be split into different FHIR resources depending on some characteristic, usually
 * what type of person they actually link to. So a PKBPerson of type PATIENT becomes a Patient resource; all others
 * become Practitioners. Instituteusers for practitioners become PractitionerRoles, otherwise they become consents, etc.
 * This is a bit trickier, so for these, we capture the target resource in the fhir_store_sync row.
 *
 * We persist this information because the characteristics that determine if a PKB entity goes to resource X or Y
 * are lost entirely if the row was deleted. So if you delete an instituteuser, we need to know whether to delete it from
 * PractitionerRole or Consent, but the row on the db is gone, so you can't work this out after the fact.
 *
 * &quot;NOT_APPLICABLE&quot; means that an entity does not need to be split between multiple resources, the most common case,
 * and is either a 1:1 mapping, or collapses into another resource.
